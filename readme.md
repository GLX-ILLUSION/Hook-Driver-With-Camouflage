# Kernel Driver Hook with Hide Camouflage

This project involves a kernel driver hook with hide camouflage. Please note that its detection status is uncertain, and I'm not concerned about it. I don't have any personal use for this, so I'm releasing it as is.

A minor modification might be necessary to make it compatible with kdmapper and other mappers. However, I believe that if you're interested in this repository, you already have a basic understanding of drivers, making this adjustment relatively straightforward.

I won't be providing any support for this project.
